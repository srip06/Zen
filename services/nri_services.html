 <h3><font color="15B9FF">  NRI Services</h3></font> 
 
<p align="justify">
ZEN Securities offers a total solution to its NRI clients. We offer services under the RBI's Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS) to buy and sell shares through the Indian stock exchanges.
</p> 

<p align="justify">
We coordinate with the RBI approved Bank to open an NRI account. We will also open the Brokerage account and the Demat Account for the NRI. These three accounts will be opened simultaneously in the NRI's name.
</p> 

<p align="justify">
We will coordinate the transfer of shares to/from NRI's demat account and money to/from NRI's bank account as per the settlement.
</p> 

<p align="justify">
We have setup a separate NRI Services team to guide the NRI through the application process and the day to day investment process.
