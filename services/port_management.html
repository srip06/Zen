<b>Why ZEN PMS?</b>
<ul> 
<li>In today's markets, equity investment has become a more involved activity and demands a greater awareness and in depth understanding of the business and economic variables that affect equity valuations.</li> 
<li>Stocks operate in a wonderful tax environment, with no tax on long-term capital gains and a minimal 10% tax on short-term capital gains. Also in this economy, there are no investment avenues other than stocks and real estate to earn inflation adjusted positive return and stocks offer more liquidity than real estate. Zen's portfolio managers fully understand these advantages of stocks and make them work in your favor.</li>
